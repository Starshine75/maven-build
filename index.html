            <p>Our white wedding held on the <em>28th of January 2023.</em> <br>
                It was such and amazing day and it has been from one testimony to the other
                from that day. There has been quite some challenging times we've had,
                but God has helped us through it all the same

            <h4>MY WIFE</h4>
            <p>My wife is such an amazing woman who has been used by God to strengthen me 
                in ways I cannot count at all. She is strong, courageous, loving and very 
                supportive. I look forward to the day soon where i'll get her all the things
                she need and even more.
